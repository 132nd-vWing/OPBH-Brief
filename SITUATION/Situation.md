## Strategic situation
Tensions with Iran had increased significantly since the beginning of 2010. The Israeli military seized a cargo ship 
carrying nuclear material on January 24th while on its way to Syria. After an international investigation, it was 
determined that the material originated from an Iranian power plant located near the city of Kerman. Intelligence also 
pointed to the Iranian government’s direct involvement in the transport of nuclear material. Further sanctions were 
placed on Iran by the US and most European governments. Russia and China vetoed UN security council resolution S/RES/2028 (2011). 
The resolution called for UN inspectors to be allowed into the country’s nuclear sites to confirm the nuclear material’s 
origins and how it was allowed to be exported to Syria.
