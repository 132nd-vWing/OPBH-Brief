 CVN-73 tanker ARCO (S-3B) is only to be used in case of bolters.<br>
 Do not plan to AAR from ARCO, instead AAR from SHELL prior to contacting mother.<br> 
 If ARCO AAR is required maximum uplift is 1,500 lbs for F/A-18C and 2,000 for F-14B.<br>

 As a contingency, a TACAN reset option is included in the F10 readio menu. <br>
 Only use it if the CVN-73 TACAN is INOP. <br>

 ACLS system for F-14B is inop due to the latest update. Autolands are not available. ICLS remains operational. <br>
 All CASE 3 recoveries must be hand flow with ICLS.<br>

 A-10C VHF AM presets are bugged from the last update. All frequencies will have to be manually tuned on that radio. The other radios work fine. <br>
